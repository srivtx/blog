Astro is a modern static site generator that makes building websites fun and efficient. In this post, I'll share my experience getting started with Astro.

## Why Astro?

Astro offers several advantages:

1. **Zero JavaScript by default**: Your site ships with no JavaScript unless you explicitly add it
2. **Component Islands**: Use your favorite UI frameworks where needed
3. **Excellent Performance**: Built-in optimizations for faster loading
4. **Great Developer Experience**: Simple and intuitive API

## Setting Up Your First Astro Project

Getting started is as simple as running:

```bash
npm create astro@latest
```

This command sets up a new Astro project with everything you need to start building.
